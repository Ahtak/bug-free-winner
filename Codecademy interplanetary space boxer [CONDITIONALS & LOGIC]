/*
Little Mac is an interplanetary space boxer, who is trying to win championship belts for various weight categories on other planets within the solar system.

Write a space.cpp program that helps him keep track of his target weight by:

i)    It should ask him what his earth weight is.
ii)   Ask him to enter a number for the planet he wants to fight on.
iii)  It should then compute his weight on the destination planet.

Here is the table of conversion:

#	Planet	Relative Gravity
1	Mercury	0.38
2	Venus	0.91
3	Mars	0.38
4	Jupiter	2.34
5	Saturn	1.06
6	Uranus	0.92
7	Neptune	1.19

int main() {

    double weight = 0;
    std::cout << "What is your weight? ";
    std::cin >> weight;

    int number = 0;
    std::cout << "Enter the number of the planet you want to fight on: ";
    std::cin >> number;

    switch (number) {
    case 1:
        std::cout << "Mercury " << weight * 0.38 << "\n";
        break;
    case 2:
        std::cout << "Venus " << weight * 0.91 << "\n";
